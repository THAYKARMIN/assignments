# Rainfall analysis in India between 1901-2015
- **discription:** My script, [rainfall_analysis.py](/day06/rainfall_analysis.py), calculates the mean rainfall for each year from 1901 to 2015 in different regions of India. It then plots the annual mean for each region over those years.
- **input:** I downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) a csv file of the [rainfall in India 1901-2015](/day06/rainfall_in_india_1901-2015.csv)
- **output:** The output is a plot for each region with mean annual between 1901-2015
- **test:** [test_rainfall_analysis](/day06/test_rainfall_analysis.py)
