# What My Program Does?

[seq_analysis.py](/day09/seq_analysis.py) processes a FASTA file for DNA sequence analysis, offering two required options: start_codon and longest_repitition. The user must choose at least one of these options.

start_codon: Identifies potential locations of [start codons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_codon) ('ATG') within the DNA sequence from the FASTA file.

longest_repetition: Identifies the longest subsequences that repeat themselves within the DNA sequence and prints this subsequences and it's lenght.
